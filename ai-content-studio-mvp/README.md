# AI Content Studio — MVP (Lightweight)

Minimal Next.js + OpenAI starter (skeleton only — no node_modules or .next).
Drop your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into `.env.local` before running.

## Quick start
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Notes
- This repo is intentionally lightweight for easy GitHub uploads.
- Add your OpenAI key to `.env.local`:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
